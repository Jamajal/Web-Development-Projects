I made an anonymous email sender using FormSubmit.co. 
It has a simple interface and you have to insert the email adress
in the code, because I still don't know how to get it and insert it 
via Javascript.
But I'll get there.
Also I made an page to confirm that the email was send, but the FormSubmit
requires a domain to go to the next page. I tried to create an <a> but 
with that the email wasn't being send anymore.
