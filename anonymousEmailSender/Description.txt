I made an anonymous email sender using FormSubmit.co. 
It has a simple interface and you have to insert the email adress
in the code, because I still don't know how to get it and insert it 
via Javascript.
But I'll get there.
Also I made an page to confirm that the email was send, but I don't have
an domain to acess it and I didn't use React, because this was just a little
project to practice some skills.
